        <p>With all the hype around AI - robots, self-driving cars, etc. - it can be easy to assume that AI doesn’t impact our everyday lives. In reality, most of us encounter AI in some way or the other almost every single day. From the moment you wake up to check your smartphone to watching another Netflix recommended movie, AI has quickly made its way into our everyday lives. According to a study by Statista, the global AI market is set to grow up to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607960/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-growth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">54 percent</a> every single year. But what exactly is AI? Will it really serve good to mankind in the future? Well, there are tons of advantages and disadvantages of AI which we’ll discuss in this article.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>What Is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence or AI provides a computer program the ability to think and learn on its own. It is a simulation of human intelligence (hence, artificial) into machines to do things that we would normally rely on humans. There are three main <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/types-of-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">types of AI</a> based on its capabilities - weak AI, strong AI, and super AI.</p>
        <ul>
            <li aria-level="1">Weak AI - Focuses on one task and cannot perform beyond its limitations (common in our daily lives)</li>
            <li aria-level="1">Strong AI - Can understand and learn any intellectual task that a human being can (researchers are striving to reach strong AI)</li>
            <li aria-level="1">Super AI - Surpasses human intelligence and can perform any task better than a human (still a concept)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <h3>1. Reduction in Human Error</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of AI is that it can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision. The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by information previously gathered and a certain set of algorithms. When programmed properly, these errors can be reduced to null.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>2. Zero Risks</h3>
            <p>Another big advantage of AI is that humans can overcome many risks by letting AI robots do them for us. Whether it be defusing a bomb, going to space, exploring the deepest parts of oceans, machines with metal bodies are resistant in nature and can survive unfriendly atmospheres. Moreover, they can provide accurate work with greater responsibility and not wear out easily.</p>
            <h2>Artificial Intelligence - The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence has massive potential for creating a better world to live in. The most important role for humans will be to ensure that the rise of the AI <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">doesn’t get out of hand</a>. Although there are both debatable advantages and disadvantages of AI, its impact on the global industry is undeniable. It continues to grow every single day driving sustainability for businesses.
